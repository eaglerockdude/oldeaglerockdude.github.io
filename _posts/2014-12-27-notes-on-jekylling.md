### Jekyll - The Good Parts

There are many good blogs and references out there in regards to Jekyll blogs.  Here are some that I found quite useful.

<p>
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) </br>
This is the site by a very smart guy from LA that built a frame work using Jekyll integrated with bootstrap.  While I opted
initially to not go this route in the future I may if I feel the need.  Regardless, you can learn a lot about how Jekyll works
by playing with this framework,and going thru the code.
