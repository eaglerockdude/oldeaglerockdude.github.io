  Maybe you don't know..but Jekyll the static site generator upon which this blog is based was written by Tim Berners-Lee.. not exactly Al Gore..but I never saw him stiff kissing his wife either.
  
  Another tidbit.  One of the very first "names" tossed around for what we now call the WWW was "The galactic network"  ... well...don't know about you but why not include the universe?
  
  I like tidbits.
