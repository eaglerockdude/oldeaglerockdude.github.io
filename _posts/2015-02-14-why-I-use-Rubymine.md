Anyone who does Rails is constantly trying out new tools it looks like anyway.  I think the fear is...you will go to a job, and they will
say.."we only use VIM here!"...or EMACS...well I tried them..and I hate them...but that said I did want to try one of the popular text
editors.  I use sublime, but now I have switched to Atom...they are about exactly the same but I just like the feel of Atom better.

BUT..I have always used JetBrain products going back to PHPStorm and Webstorm...so I was familiar with them, and the price was the same as
what they want for sublime(Atom is free).  Of course..we all know..Adobe made the best IDE's in history..but I guess suffer from marketing!

JetBrains ruby/rails product is Rubymine. I pretty much use it most of the time.  I can do everything that Sublime/Atom can do AND more.
Here are a few of the things that shine, and I will update this post as I find more.

## Rubymine things I like

1. Model Dependency Diagram.  It's built it.  You can see a visual representation of your model dependencies.  To me I like it for reference sometimes
when I am forgetting my "through" associations.  Here is an example of a small app:

![Rubymine Diagram]({{ site.url }}/rm_diagram.png)

2. Database Tool.  I use SQLite, MySQL, and Postgres, mostly Postgres.  For any of these database, Rubymine has a database tool
that once you configure it to point to your database, gives you a tool to do all the normal database IDE functions.  Modify records either
via a table interface, or just use SQL.  A picture is worth a thousand words:
