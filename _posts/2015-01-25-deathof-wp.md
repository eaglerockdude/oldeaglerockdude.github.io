## Goodbye Wordpress

I think we all were first exposed to blogs via Wordpress.  So many templates to choose from, and underneath the
fact that everything was stored in a database(mySQL no less) made it seem like <em>genius.</em>

But the problem you come to realize, at least for me, is the constant `SPAM`.  Each time you go into your admin, it
just seems like that are dozens of messages with nothing but gibberish.

Or my favorite...<em>"Your website is the best I have ever seen, but I can make it ever better!"</em>  Just on and on.  I think
I even PAID some entity to stop the spam...what a ripoff..they are probably sending it.

In addition to that was the speed.  Seems in the old days WP blogs were pretty fast, but I guess
after years at the keyboard, you become microwave sensitive to the speed and bandwidth.  Whenever I
went into my blog to make simple changes...everything was just too slow.  And everytime I wante to
do some type of small CSS related change..well...you had to dig deep.  There was a lot of code
(PHP) they you just needed to get past the learning curve on.   Ahh...<em>The infamous Loop!</em>

I wanted a blog for my Ruby on Rails career, because..I mean...in open source you gotta have a blog right?  At my previous
gig which was IBM iSeries...well...we never had a blog.  EVERYTHING was in the manual!  But times have changed.  These
days many parts of your life and business are an open book to the world, and I suppose you have to play or
you must be hiding <em>something.</em>

My ISP account expired in my WP blog, so I decided to go another more simple path.  It was right
in front of my face...GITHUB..which led me to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  This is my first post
under my new path, and I really like it.  And to top it off...I have complete control of my content/data
as well as my code.  It's great that under the surface its Ruby which is icing on the cake.

My old ISP wanted $75 to restore my old blog content, and you know based on principle I just
could not do it.  I decided to start totally fresh.  So that's how we got where we are.
Time to go.  Happy New Year.
