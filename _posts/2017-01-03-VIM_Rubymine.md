### Handy-Dandy stuff!      
Like all developers, I have played and used many IDE's too many to even recall, but I eventually settled on RubyMine.  I like there products.  I also have owned PHPStorm and I also have WebStorm.  See when you know one IDE from JetBrains all the others kind of work the same way.

BUT..the thing is, no matter where you go you always are finding coders that just rant and rave about VIM, so at various times I have checked it out.  As far as just editing code and text, I think its great.  But all the surrounding features that a more modern IDE gives me..well thats what i miss.  Rubymine has too many features to mention(plus tons of plugins which support just about every coding language)  but some of my favorite things are a database explorer built in and a cool rspec interface.

I recently found out that Rubymine has a VIM plugin!  Wow...while it does not incorporate every single feature of the original VIM, it does pretty much support all of the text operations which I just love.

So for now, I am getting the best of BOTH worlds.  RubyMine and VIM.  So its true like in the movies....you can go back to the future.
