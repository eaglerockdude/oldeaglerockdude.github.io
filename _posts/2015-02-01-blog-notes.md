## Blog notes
I wrote on another post [Wordpress Death]({% post_url 2015-01-25-deathof-wp %}) about why I abandoned my previous WP based blog.  It was becoming
 a distraction, not so much the content but rather and administration of wp itself.  What do those spammers hope to accomplish anyway. They
 have moved from your home phone to your home website.
 
 That blog started late 2014 and had lots of Ruby and Rails notes based on my Tealeaf Academy bootcamp experience.  My previous hosting
 provided want $75 to restore my site once I cancelled it but I was not in the mood.
 
 I am going to start fresh here.  Rather than notes about ruby hashes or check boxes, I think this time I am going to keep it higher level,
 and possible blog about ...well lets see where it goes.
