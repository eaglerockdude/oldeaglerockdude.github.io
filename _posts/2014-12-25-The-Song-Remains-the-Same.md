## Goodbye iSeries

The date of this blog is Christmas Day.  I think on Christmas day I was doing the things most Dad's do, trying to manage the
Christmas present wrapping paper trash, and at the same time reliving christmas past thru the christmas present with my
family. At this age I am past presents, at least the physical ones.  Been there done that.

I have reached a decision point in my working life.  The type I development I have done for years is fading away. And I realized that
in order to keep doing what I really enjoy as a job I need to re-tool.  I decided to move to Ruby and Ruby on Rails.  I started Tealeaf Academy
and I am not looking back.  My friends say "hey...Christmas is for kids!"..but I say...everyone enjoys Christmas.  Wish me luck.
