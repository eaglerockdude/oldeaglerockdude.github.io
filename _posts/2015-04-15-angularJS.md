I have delved some with Handlebars, Mustache..well...I get them confused..they all have the mustaches right?  Sometimes I think
somewhere in the GIT universe there is this one giant repo from which everything is forked.  Until I find it I will continue looking at
trees in the forest.

I have changed gears to so speak.  So many javascript things of interest to learn, but Angular to me looks the most promising right now.
I will keep notes here on what i learn about angular and javascript.


{% highlight javascript linenos %}

// MODULE  definition
var angularApp = angular.module('angularApp', []);

// CONTROLLER definition
angularApp.controller('mainController', ['$scope', function ($scope) {

}]);

{% endhighlight %}
