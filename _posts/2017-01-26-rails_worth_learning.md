### Is Rails still relevant in the Trump era?
I confess.  I got caught up in the javascript hype.  I mean..its the only language that runs
in all browsers.  Included with no installation.  Language while it has some flaws is damn
cool in terms of being fully functional. BUT...whats the deal with all of these module loaders
and all that crap....I mean....how smart are we supposed to be anyway.  Typescript?  What the
fck is that..
 
*DHH the INVENTER or rails..who also happens to drive race-cars...damn his eye.**
