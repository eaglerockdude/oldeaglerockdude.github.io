In the majority of my developer life I have been what is termed a _mid-range programmer_, a term that I suppose is meant to distinguish it from the "main-frame" guys in the old days.
Honestly..most recruiters you happen to speak to these days...they think as/400 is a mainframe...and what a mainframe is..well..I have no idea.  But we know ;>)

About me
---
_I enjoy programming._  I am an experienced iSeries /AS400 Application Developer and Analyst with over 20 years on the mid-range system.  Any and all the languages ever used on the platform in addition to SQL and DB/2 expertise.  Most places use RPG/free these days, but I can code it all.  Even the cycle.  I can fill any role from analyst to DBA to developer to project lead.   

I can adapt to your methodology(Agile/scrum for example) as I have seen most of them.  The bottom line is getting the job done. 

_All my years of experience have led me to a simple approach and philosophy.  Each project or problem undertake is guided by basic principles._

* Understand the problem in sufficient detail before solving it.
* Keep it simple if possible.
* Communicate continuously and thoroughly.
* Time is money.

Timeline of qualifying experience

_Since I have been on this platform 20 years plus I did not think it made sense to put every single thing I have ever done. I doubt it would get read.  I only list here the last 10 years of my experience for brevity.  If your particular requirement calls for some specialized skill I will add it or ask me.  From my experience every programming situation is different but there are common solutions and best practices which are more a function of experience over time that any one job that I did. Also since the big one(crash) things have changed a lot in the iSeries world.  I have been contracting mostly because the new paradigm seems to be not hiring perm anymore.  Its not a reflection of what I prefer but rather a reflection of the times._
