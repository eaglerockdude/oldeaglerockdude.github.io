# Jekyll Blog based on Lanyon

Hello

My name is Ken McFadden.  I am a Los Angeles/Southern California based iseries and ruby on rails developer.

This blog is a repository of things related to programming both in the as/400 and open source realms.

Like most developers I know more than one language, and I have two resumes online.  One for As/400- iSeries, and one for Ruby on Rails/Ruby.

I am most experienced on iSeries.
