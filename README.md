# Jekyll Blog based on Lanyon

As part of my Ruby on Rails Bootcamp course it was suggested that we start a blog.  Initially I had a wordpress blog where I kept notes on
class exercises.

Things like Sinatra, Ajax, Ruby nuances and of course Rails.

Read my post  if interested as to why I switched to a Jekyll based blog.
