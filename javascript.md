<p>
In addition to Rails and Ruby, this blog is about javascript.  As you know, ROR is the domain of the "back-end" and while you can accomplish javascript
type things with a templating language(ajax, buttons, you name it) the bottom line is everything is moving to javascript and related frameworks.  In particular,
Node.js, which is a framework with a non-blocking I/O event model. Basically it's much faster with big loads.  I would think however
that only the biggest of companies(Walmart etc) would really need this kind of performance.  For the vast majority
of websites, a framework like ROR will suffice.

In my mind no developer should be without an understanding of this movement as javascript exists in every browser and web application in existence.

## Areas of interest

Blogging for the most part in the context of javascript will probably include the following:
* AngularJS
   * So many to choose from but this is having the most momentum.
* Functional Programming
    * Javascript in general has so many odd constructs and concepts.  I feel that understanding functional programming as it relates to javascript kills two birds with one stone so to speak.
