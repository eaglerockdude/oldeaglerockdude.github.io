<p>
In addition to Rails and Ruby, this blog is about javascript.  As you know, ROR is the domain of the "back-end" and while you can accomplish javascript
type things with a templating language(ajax, buttons, you name it) the bottom line is everything is moving to javascript and related frameworks.

<p>
In my mind no developer should be without an understanding of this movement as javascript exists in every browser and web application in existence.

## Areas of interest

Blogging for the most part in the context of javascript will probably include the following:
* AngularJS
   * So many to choose from but this is having the most momentum.
* Functional Programming
    * Javascript in general has so many odd constructs and concepts.  I feel that understanding functional programming as it relates to javascript kills two birds with one stone so to speak.
