title: Functional programming
---
I stumbled across a really good book [Functional Programming in Javascript by Dan Mantyla] [1] on functional programming based on javascript.  This goes hand in hand with my study
and analysis of angularJS.  And in general, functional programming can only be done in certain languages.  Ruby happens to be one
of them as well as javascript which doubles the relevance for me.
## Concepts of interest

* What makes a language functional?

<cite>"Functional programming languages are languages that facilitate the functional programming paradigm. At the risk of oversimplifying, we could say that, if a language includes the features required for functional programming,
 then it is a functional language.." </cite> ( Dan Mantyla Functional Programming in Javascript.)

The following definition overview is taken from the book  [Functional Programming in Javascript by Dan Mantyla] [1].  Follow the  link to purchase.

* What are some advantages of functional programming
    * Cleaner code   (this pretty much covers the next three right?)
    * Modularity
    * Reuse(of the modules)
    * Reduced coupling (modifying one function will not affect another)
